Optimizing frame captures from the videos
- "Kazama Iroha" took around 15 mins to run initially, with no optimization
- Optimizations: 
	- bottleneck is likely the writing to disk
	- thus, multithreading may be bottlenecked her
	- instead, we would like to queue the writes whilst also fetching further frames
	- multithreading could make it faster by producing a similar result of one thread fetching whilst the other is writing
